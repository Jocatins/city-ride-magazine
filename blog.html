        <h2>Room 306 what actually happened</h2>
        <p>
          If you are familiar with the social media then you will know that
          Nigerians know how to catch cruise by blowing things out of
          proportion. I remember going online just like every other day as usual
          I checked out the post on one of the groups I belong to and I noticed
          that once new members introduce themselves and end with somebody
          should show my room, the next thing you see’’ Room 306 is available,
          come join me in room 306, Room 306 this Room 306 that. Then I became
          anxious about what exactly happened in room 306. This curiosity
          brought out the Jack Baur in me, questions upon questions,
          investigations upon investigations and boom here it was on full HD. It
          turns out room 306 is actually a room in one of the hotels in center
          of excellence where the soundtrack of a couple was disturbing all
          other occupants to the extent that some of them had to record the room
          number and the loud soundtrack emanating from bed fight and posted
          them online while social media users had a field day but until this
          day nobody knows the singers and the dancers of this particular room.
          But wait o, the way the ladies are welcoming guys to room 306, does it
          mean this is something they crave for, does it mean this is a wild
          fantasy for the ladies, one Facebook comment read’’na guy wey calm
          down go enjoy room 306’’ and that made me wonder if we are still in
          touch with our home training because the way we throw cautions to the
          wind on social media omo I tire oo. Well, I believe whatever happened
          in room 306 should stay in room 306 and not spread like misguided
          gospel preached by those justifying their loss of self-control , I
          still believe in the sanctity of legal sex by marriage but this no
          mean say’’ I holy pass’’ maybe we should check room 307.

        <h2>042 Code</h2>
        <p>
          042 is not just a code, it is a way of life, a city on the Hill
          standing tall like a mighty Colossus unperturbed, unashamed and
          unshaken yet her arms are stretched to welcome all irrespective of
          religion and tribe, it is a city where strangers become friends and
          friends become brothers, it is a City full of life, during the day she
          stands as a beacon of hope and strength for those who troll the
          streets in search of a better life and at night she stands as that
          lamp on the Hill radiating beautiful light for all to see. It is that
          city that houses over 400 autonomous communities with different
          dialect yet embraced as one, it is a city where tribalism is abhorred
          and brotherhood enthroned, it is the city of heroes where people are
          willing to sacrifice for what is right and just it is a city where
          violence is a stranger and love a king. 042 has given birth to both
          legends and Superheroes, it gives birth to stars and nurtures them to
          giants, it's a place where dreams come true where talent recognized
          and harnessed. 042 is also the home of Rangers International who has
          not just made Enugu but the country proud. In 042 when the drum sounds
          the people gather because a call to one is a call to all because we
          are our brother's keeper. It is a proud home of natural palm wine and
          beautiful delicacies like legendary okpa, Abacha, Achicha, Ayaraya and
          Ewa soup among others. In coal City everyone understands that they are
          part of a whole and as such must contribute their own quota towards
          the progress of the city, this explains the reason when a tragedy
          occurs and Justice people gather to set things right irrespective of
          who is involved because “we watch Brothers back” . To an outsider 042
          is just your regular telephone code but for indigenes and residents it
          is beyond that, it is a city of love, brotherhood, peace, hospitality
          hope, a city of giants and the City on the Hill.

        <h2>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE;A THREAT TO HUMAN WORKFORCE?</h2>
        <p>
          There is no doubt that the future belongs to technology because humans
          will never stop at nothing to ensure life are made easier. The advent
          of Computer Systems created a wide fear of the unknown with some
          frequently questions like will it not affect quality of lives? Will it
          not take away jobs thereby spiking the rate of unemployment which
          ultimately gives birth to crimes? Some even went as far as calling it
          demonic but today we have seen that it has created more jobs and made
          life easier but will that be the case with AI. What is Artificial
          Intelligence (AI)? Simply put, it is when computer systems or machines
          perform functions with intelligence that mimics that of humans. These
          machines perform functions like the human brain does for humans.
          Typical examples include smart or self-driven cars. These cars have
          the same intelligence as the human brain. They know when to stop, take
          a right or left turn even obey traffic. Another example is Google App
          which guides a driver through unknown routes, spots traffic, congested
          routes, suggesting alternate routes and estimated time of a trip which
          removes the untidiness of having to stop and ask for directions or
          make constant u- turns on encountering traffic. IS IT A THREAT TO
          HUMAN WORK FORCE? As humans develop this technology, there is fear
          that blue and white collar jobs will be lost to these smart machines.
          For example, the invention of smart or self-driven cars can take the
          jobs of delivery men, cab drivers etc. We were able to see smart
          machines in hospitals at the peak of COVID 19. Artificial intelligent
          robots were seen delivering drugs and food to patients, reducing human
          contact. This for sure is a threat to human work force with machines
          being able to do most things that are done by humans but the vast
          opinion is that this technology is at infancy and still has a long way
          to go before they can eliminate human workforce. In Africa for
          instance, we have a lot of infrastructural hurdles, insecurity etc.,
          to contend with making this threat so distant. Another important
          factor is that these machines are still made by humans and the
          computer programs driving these machines are man-made. It still
          depends on humans to decide if we want to lose jobs to machines. These
          machines should be made to make life easier and not make life extinct
          by taking away our livelihood. Change is constant as life is ever
          evolving and technology keeps advancing. Jobs will be created in that
          area and other areas of life. Fears were nursed at the advent of
          computers. We have seen that computers have made life easier and
          created a lot of jobs for the younger population of the world.
